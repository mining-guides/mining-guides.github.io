        <h2>Already Owned:</h2>
        <p>Already have all Fine Gemstones on your Sorrow Armor and Gemstone Gauntlet</p>

        <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
        <p>Buy Jaded, Recombobulated Divan Armor with 3 out of 5 chambers unlocked in each piece. You should have two Perfect Jades and one Perfect Topaz. Sell your Sorrow after you get this... obviously</p>
        <p>Upgrade your Ring of Power to an Artifact of Power and put a Perfect Topaz in it</p>
        <p>Get the final two chambers of your Divan Armor, and put Flawless Ambers in each slot</p>
        <p>Buy a Titanium Artifact</p>
        <p>Put a Perfect Amber into your Gemstone Gauntlet</p>
        <p>Put two Perfect Ambers into each of your Divan pieces</p>
        <p>Buy a Titanium Relic</p>
        <p>Recombobulate your Artifact of Power</p>
        <p>Put a Perfect Jade into your Artifact of Power</p>
        <p>Put a Perfect Amber into your Artifact of Power</p>
        <p>Buy a Titanium Drill DR-X655 with all Perfect Gemstones, Recombobulated, Fortune 4, Efficiency 5, Pristine 5, a Titanium-infused Fuel Tank, and a Sunny Side Goblin Omelete (make sure to forge the Titanium Drill DR-X655 from a Titanium Drill DR-X355 to save like 50 million coins, and only takes 1.5 minutes to forge)</p>
        <p>Buy a Ruby-polished Drill Engine for your Titanium Drill DR-X655 (you can also forge these drill engines to save money)</p>
        <p>Sell your Ruby-polished Drill Engine for a Sapphire-polished Drill Engine</p>
        <p>Sell your Sapphire-polished Drill Engine for an Amber-polished Drill Engine</p>
        <p>Buy a second drill with a Blue Cheese Goblin Omelete (this will be explained later in the video)</p>
        <p>Buy a Quick Claw for your Bal</p>
        <p>Get all Perfect Gemstones in your Artifact of Power</p>
        <p>Buy 5 Polarvoid books and apply them on your drill</p>
        <p>Buy a Gemstone Fuel Tank</p>
        <p>Buy a Divan's Alloy and forge with your current Titanium Drill DR-X655 for a Divan's Drill (enjoy downtime while it's forging, or do something else in the game for a while)</p>
        <p>Get Efficiency 10 on your Divan's Drill</p>
        <p>Recombobulate all of your equipment</p>
        <p>10 star your Vanquished Glowstone Gauntlet</p>
        <p>Then, finally, the Perfectly-Cut Fuel Tank</p>
        <h2>Other Upgrades:</h2>
        <p>Get a Black Belt (or, if you're struggling, Gillsplash).</p>
        <p>Get a Rift necklace</p>
        <p>Recombobulate this equipment following the normal upgrade order.</p>
        <h2>About Mining V3:</h2>
        <p>Mining V3 has also added more things like mining fortune from tungsten/umber/glacite collections and a relic of power/new equipment pieces. These will be added when prices for the items stabilize.</p>
