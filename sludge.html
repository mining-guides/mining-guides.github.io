    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>The main feature of this money-making method is that it requires virtually no gear and can be done right after reaching HOTM 7 as an easy and skill-less way to save up for Divan’s armor and a 655 before getting started.</p>
        <p>Sludge mining involves using a jungle pickaxe on blocks in the jungle to get sludge at a rate of 2% chance per block. By using efficient miner, mole, and mineral armor, the amount of blocks broken will increase which leads to an increase in sludge.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="powder">
        <h2>Powder Requirements</h2>
        <p>This method requires only enough powder for 1800 mining speed to instamine ores, and a decent mole level, up to 171 as the mole perk is still bugged. Also get levels of efficient miner in case any ores appear, which are extra profits.</p>
        <p>A decent amount of powder would be 4m/4m (mithril & gemstone), but you can still do this money making method with less powder, albeit with less profits. As with most mining-related money making methods, powder is critical for profits.</p>
        <p><strong>HoTM tree:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most important perks:</strong></li>
            <li>Enough mining speed 1 and 2 to get to 1800 mining speed in mineral armor with jungle pickaxe</li>
            <li>Mole perk (as many levels as possible up to 171)</li>
            <li>Efficient miner</li>
            <li>Spend the excess on mining fortune 1 and 2</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="gear">
        <h2>Gear Requirements</h2>
        <p><strong>4/4 Mineral Armor</strong> (Can be swapped out for Divan)</p>
        <p><strong>Pets:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scatha Pet: Gives a bit more fortune</li>
            <li>Snail Pet: Increases fortune on hard stone, extra profits</li>
            <li>Use a pet item for extra mining fortune and speed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Jungle Pickaxe</strong> (MANDATORY, preferably on Refined reforge)</p>
    </section>
    <section id="method">
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Get to around y-level 182 in the Crystal Hollows, this will ensure structures don’t interrupt your mining. Then, mine in a circular sweeping motion to break as many blocks as possible.</p>
        <p>That’s it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="rates">
        <h2>Rates</h2>
        <p>Some decent rates should be about 1.5 (1-2) sludge per second, or 90 per minute, or 5400 per hour. Without including ores, at current bazaar prices this is 18 million coins per hour.</p>
        <p>You can also mine large coal ore veins, though you shouldn’t go out of your way as they are not the main source of profit from this money making method.</p>
        <p>Including ores, this method can earn over $20m+/h with a setup that’s only a few million coins, and up to 30m+/h with a more expensive setup.</p>
        <p>Rates are dependent on bazaar prices so they can vary.</p>
    </section>
