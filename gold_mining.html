        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Gold is an ore that is found throughout the mining islands, but is most commonly mined in the Mines of Divan, which can be found in the Crystal Hollows.</p>
        <p>Gold spawns here in a large quantity, so it is perfect for grinding collection.</p>

        <h2>Powder Requirements</h2>
        <p>The recommended mithril powder to start gold mining is 3.9m mithril powder, so you are able to max mining speed 1 and mining fortune 1.</p> 
        <p>Efficient miner doesnt work on mines of divan gold, so powder doesnt need to be put into it.</p>
        <p>The recommended gemstone powder for gold mining is 7.4m gemstone powder, so you are able to max mining speed 2 and mining fortune 2 for max rates.</p>

        <h2>Gear Requirements</h2>
        <p>3/4 Mineral Armor with 1/4 divan</p>
        <p>Legendary bal with quick claw</p>
        <p>Maxed Divan's drill (preferably, can be done with a 655 tho)</p>
        <p>Any drill with a blue cheese goblin omelette</p>
        <p>Other mining essentials like equipment, talismans etc should be used.</p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Use a wishing compass at the entrance of the mithril deposits, if the game tells you "The Wishing Compass can't seem to locate anything! (16)"</p>
        <p>there is no MoD in your lobby if the compass works follow the compass towards the Mines Of Divan</p>
        <p>you can use Neu's wishing compass solver to get the exact cords of the structure (if there is one in the lobby) after you used it two times.</p>
        <p>You want to repeat this process until you find a mines of divan where you can mine the gold blocks while having the bal buff activated</p>
        <p>the best type of MoD is the one where you dont have to dig down while still staying at y64</p>

        <h2>Instamining</h2>
        <p>36k mining speed is required to instamine gold blocks, this require 6.5k mining speed with bal or 7.2k mining speed without bal</p>
        <p>when using a blue cheese goblin omelette on your secondary drill or with 9k base mining speed without using a blue cheese goblin omelette</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Collection for Golden dragon perk<p>
