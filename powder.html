        <h2>What is Powder Grinding?</h2>
        <p>Powder Grinding is mining in the Crystal Hollows for chests, and gaining Powder to upgrade your Heart of the Mountain (HOTM) tree.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="requirements">
        <h2>Hotm requirement</h2>

         <section id="Recommended">
        <h2>Recommended (Not Needed) Gear</h2>
            <li>Young Dragon (Extra Speed)</li>
            <li>Mithril Drill SX-R226/326 (Cheaper, gives more Mithril Powder) (OVERALL BETTER)</li>
            <li>OR</li>
            <li>Ruby/Gemstone/Topaz/Jasper Drill (More Expensive, gives more Gemstone Powder)</li><br>
            <p>Although 326 and Jasper give the same amount of Powder Buff, 20% for Mithril and Gemstone respectively, it is recommended to get a</p>
            <p>mithril drill. When Gemstone mining, it is easy to get overflow Gemstone Powder, and harder to get overflow Mithril. That's why when/<p>
            <p>Powder Mining, you want to get as much extra Mithril powder as you can, because its always possible to get more Gemstone Powder while</p>
            <p>gemstone mining, but not possible to gain mithril while gemstone mining.</p>
        </section>
    <section id="Pets">
        <h2>Pets</h2>
        <p>For Powder Mining, one pet that is eligible to use is a Rare Scatha. A Rare Scatha would be the best to use because of its ability to give up to a 25% higher</p>
        <p>chance to get a treasure chest. Although the Epic Mithril Golem and Legendary Scatha do grant</p>
        <p>abilities to gain 20% more Mithril and Gemstone Powder respectively, the abilities are bugged with Crystal Hollows chests, the exact</p>
        <p>chests used to Powder Mine, rendering them useless until further progression. Although Scatha Pet is not required, it is recommended,</p>
        <p>but not at all needed.</p>
        <p>If a Scatha Pet is outside a budget, try to afford something that gives fortune, for example, a legendary Bee pet which is around 2.5 million.</p>
        <p>Again, not needed.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="where">
        <h2>Where Should I Mine?</h2>
            <p>There are two areas best for powder mining. Pre-Nerf, the best area was the Jungle, but since sludge prices have tanked, there are now </p>
            <p>better areas. The overall best area for Powder Mining is the Precursor City, as it gives the highest chance to roll Powder as a loot drop, and </p>
            <p>it also drops robot parts. There is always the Jungle, which makes the most money, but makes less powder than the Precursor City. (See Images 1 and 2 respectively) </p>
            <p>1 Precursor City</p><br>

    <section id="leveling">
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Post-Nerf, there have not been anyone new upgrades for Powder Grinding, try to keep a balance between mole and powder buff early on,</p>
        <p>but prioritize Great Explorer, as it now is able to instantly open chests without having to pick a lock.</p>
        <p>Once you hit Great Explorer 20, advance on the upgrades like normal.</p>
